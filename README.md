  - DB server (can be used normally)  
  - Outer gateway (used normally)  
  - Inner gateway (used normally)  
  - Login service (can be used normally)  
  - Game clothes (Basic prototype has been established, game logic can be added later, rpc interface has been added)  
  - Pluggable logging system  
  - CPU and memory log analysis (pprof with related server performance analysis)  
  - protobuf network protocol, and go and lua protocol generation tools  
  - Supported external configuration file tools [xExcel2x](https://github.com/Peakchen/xExcel2x) developed externally, system configuration       file code generation tools [xExport4Go](https://github.com/Peakchen/xExport4Go)  
  - simulate (unit test module + automated test)  
  - go mod external dependencies  
  - win batch can directly compile and run to compile the program  
  - Support stack record statistics of database operations after message reception  
  - Config Hot Update   
  - Server time synchronization mechanism  
  - prometheus and prafana minitor data  
  - Multi-node from external network gateway to multi-node from internal network gateway, newly added data distribution center by consul (Planning)
